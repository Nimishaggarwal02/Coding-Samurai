# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb Listings
This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listings. The analysis aims to gain insights into various aspects of Airbnb listings, such as pricing, location trends, and property characteristics.

# Project Description
This project was undertaken by Nimish Aggarwal under the internship of coding samurai. I am thankful for this opportunity and explore my skills through this data science project.

## Some insights
- From The Heatmap we can see that Price is heavily correlated with accomodities, beds, guest included, cleaning fee, weekly monthly and security deposit price.
- The graph shows the distribution of prices for Airbnb listings. The vast majority of listings are priced below $1,000. The most common price range is $100-$200. There are a small number of listings that are priced above $600.
- Most Preferred Room Was Entire Home/Aartment then Private Room and then Shared Room.
- Mostly Review was Positive from the Reviewer.
- The Most Visited City Was Broadway and Least is Roxhill.
Availability of room was in good number in peak season the unavailability also increases. Summer Season has the Highest Listing in all years.
